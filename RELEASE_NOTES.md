#### Test Report view support

Using the _Cargo Test_ launch configuration will now show the Test Report view to present test progress and failures. This view also provide useful controls to re-run some tests or inspect previous test sessions.

#### Support Debug for Cargo Tests

The _Cargo Test_ launch can now happen in debug. The children test execution of the `cargo` process are monitored and a debugger is attached when suitable to provide the capability to inspect execution, use breakpoints and so on.

Note that because test can execute very fast, faster than the time it takes to attach a debugger, some tests may seem to be missed. In this case, the test code needs to be tweak to leave time to debugger to be attached, for example with some `std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));` preliminary step.

#### Some Launch Configurations may need review

Some internal change in Launch Configuration may make some pre-existing launch configurtion non-fonctional. In that case, simply review them via the Launch Configuration dialog, and ensure all expected fields are set, and reset them if needed.
